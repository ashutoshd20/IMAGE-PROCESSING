# IMAGE-PROCESSING
Image processing techniques implemented from scratch

### 1. Cyclone analyser:
This is a jupyter notebook demonstrating the processing of tracting and obtaining the point of collision of two cyclones from the info of initial 3 positions of cyclones.It takes into account the change in speed of cyclone movements with geographic location of earth.

### 2. Contast enhancement:
a) Applies gamma enhancement 
b) Uses histogram equalization
c) All these function are implemented from scratch

### 3. Decompression
a) uses technique of upsampling to obtain high quality image from the compressed images obtained
b) can be applied in JEPG 

### 4. Denoiser
a) used for removing noise from the image
b) uses weighted gaussian for implementation

### 5. Shadow_removal
a) removes shadow from images making them clear
b) uses sharpening techniques to prevent loss of data
